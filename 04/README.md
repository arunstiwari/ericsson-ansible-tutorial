Create a password file for your new Vault using the command:

echo "my long password" > password_file
Then run this command to create the vault:

ansible-vault create --vault-id ./password_file more_secrets.yaml
Later try decrypting this with:

ansible-vault decrypt --vault-id ./password_file more_secrets.yaml
Check the contents to ensure decryption was successful.
